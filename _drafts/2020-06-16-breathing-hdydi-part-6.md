A few things happened recently where the penny finally dropped for me.
I was talking with someone going through a tough time, they were asking me what to do. I said "Breathe". They responded "What?". I proceeded to explain as simple as it sounds try and slow your thoughts and focus on what's happening now by just stopping. And. Breathing. Slowly.



In marketing (and change management) they say you need to hear a message 5-7 times before acting. For me, because of the multitude of terms used and my preconceived perception (unconscious bias) I've been slow on the uptake of mindfulness. I swear I've been told about the same thing (different ways) 30+ times over the last 5-7 years. I've even given it a go and suggested others should try parts of the concept. 

If you want to save yourself the trouble,

A few days later [redkite was asking](https://www.facebook.com/redkitecharity/photos/a.200618619683/10158788184749684/) what would you say to parent who was just diagnosed. My response was, Breathe.

How can something so simple be over complicated! How many words describe the same thing; meditation, contemplation, reflection, sitting, breathing. Then add adjectives to it to make it sound different. Admittedly, some of these things are applied in different ways, but when you're starting out it's bloody confusing.

I touched on this in the [mates](/2017/08/16/mates-how-do-you-do-it-part-3)and the [tips to other parents](/2017/08/18/tips-to-other-parents-hdydi-part-5).

When I thought of meditation, I thought of a stereotypical vegan zen monk burning incense or hippies raking sand, balancing stones and sitting cross-legged under a tepee. That's not me, and further to that I thought meditation was not aligned with my faith, because I hadn't seen it in church. Reality is I don't need to be a monk or hippy, it's mentioned multiple times in the bible AND it's not complicated, you can stop, breathe and observe your thoughts anywhere. 


It wasn't until I saw this [TED talk](https://youtu.be/UQzvNIIMayo) and [associated article](https://ideas.ted.com/4-simple-exercises-to-strengthen-your-attention-and-reduce-distractibility/) that it started to click. I mentioned the TED talk in a chat and someone else pointed me in the direction of the [My Year Living Mindfully](https://www.myyearoflivingmindfully.com/) documentary and which led me to the

I've now started the basics course in the headspace app and it's all coming together, the years of different conversations are making more sense.
