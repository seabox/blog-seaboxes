After a couple of months of “not being 100%” then 2 weeks of diagnosis at Lady Cilento (LCCH), on 12 November 2015, my youngest of three children, Violet(6) was diagnosed with stage 4 Neuroblastoma, a tumorous cancer  slightly larger than a tennis ball (78 x 66 x 83mm) growing on Violet’s adrenal gland on her left kidney. Being stage 4 the cancer has metastasised and is in all her bones and marrow. Childhood cancer <a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/incidence/age">is rare</a>, and neuroblastoma in kids older than 2 is rarer.

Violet is now in the 4<sup>th</sup> chemotherapy cycle (of 6x3 week cycles). After chemo, there’s surgery to remove the tumour, radiotherapy, then antibody therapy. Overall a 12-24 month treatment protocol. <a href="http://redkite.realviewdigital.com/?iid=100711#folio=FC">Lucy has a Tumour</a> is a kids book that gives a good overview of the process we’re going through, <a href="http://www.cncfhope.org/High_Risk_Neuroblastoma_Treatment">this page</a> give a bit more detail on what the actual treatment protocol is, but as I’ve learnt over the last month, the only constant is change.

![Image of a Violet](/assets/img/posts/violet.jpg "Violet") Violet is adapting well to the new normal, she has her off days (usually around the first 10 days of the cycle), however she is mostly up. As you can see by the photo her smile and cheeky nature still shine through; she’s an inspiration to us all.

Colleen and I have been blown away by the support from our family, friends, school and church during this time; with the biggest support from my parents who cancelled one of their 2+ month retirement holidays and have moved in to help with Oliver and Piper and around the house.

I couldn’t speak more highly of the LCCH facility or staff, the media likes a bad story but LCCH is first class and I haven’t come across more dedicated, passionate people than those that work and volunteer there.

My work has been awesome with their support and have helped take the worry of work away for a while. Colleen has put university on hold for a little while

There is so much more I could say, but if you want more direct updates please <a href="https://www.facebook.com/seabox">friend me on FB</a>
