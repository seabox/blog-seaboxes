We’ve been asked many times how can you help. We've actually been overwhelmed with support, so much so that we've created a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/violethelp/">facebook group</a> to organise everyone.

The reality is, for now, we feel we have enough physical support (a couple of meals a week, lawns being mowed etc.).

<img class=" alignright" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/6f/6d/81/6f6d81bb15a485d34e9f6779ceb44fad.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="293" /> Spiritually, words of encouragement and prayer will never turned down. Follow my <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/craigbox/my-god/">Pintrest board</a> or <a href="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aseaboxes%3Aplaylist%3A598Fkv6zMTWZaZguLeweVz">Spotify playlist</a> to see what I'm reading or listening to. Prayer points and focused prayer around the following is appreciated:
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height:1.7;">Miraculous healing</span></li>
	<li>The treatment protocol goes to plan with limited disruption (biggest threat is delay by infection)</li>
	<li>Mental and physical strength for Colleen and I to support us and our kids on this journey</li>
	<li>Strength for our larger support network</li>
	<li>Understanding and health for Violets siblings</li>
	<li>Skillful surgeon hands and successful removal of "Mr Weed" (the tumor)</li>
</ul>
<span style="line-height:1.7;">If you're still looking to do or give something, look at the charities below that have helped us so far:</span>
<ul>
	<li>Firstly, we want kids in the future to be diagnosed sooner, have less toxic treatments and survive cancer. The <a href="https://ccia.org.au/">Children's Cancer Institute</a> is the only independent medical research institute in Australia wholly dedicated to childhood cancer.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.donateblood.com.au/">Red Cross Blood Service</a> – Violet has had numerous whole blood and platelet transfusions. If you’re unsure if you can give, <a href="http://www.donateblood.com.au/eligibility">take the quiz</a> then take a buddy along to hold your hand on your first donation.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.childrens.org.au/who-we-are/">Children’s Hospital Foundation</a> funds clinical research and medical equipment as well as organising the 500+ volunteers at the hospital; the volunteers are awesome, entertaining kids, helping you get around and generally making hospital not feel so clinical.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.redkite.org.au/">Redkite</a> have been awesome, they fund some of the social workers in the oncology ward and have provided us with a lot of books to help the education of mental journey of dealing with cancer, but they do so much more for those in financial need etc.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.campquality.org.au/about-us">Camp Quality</a> have helped provided a distraction from treatment, Violet loves when the puppets visit her room and take her mind off being in hospital. Camp Quality also do <a href="https://www.campquality.org.au/how-we-help/find-a-program/puppet-show-kids?_type=at-school">cancer education at school</a> and <a href="https://www.campquality.org.au/how-we-help/find-a-program/?_type=away-from-it-all">family fun days and camps</a>.</li>
</ul>
A few people have asked if broader fundraising can be done for our family, at this stage, please wait. Accepting help from others is something I find hard, because “I can do it myself”… It’s something Colleen and I would like to happen, but maybe a few months down the track when we know what would work best.
