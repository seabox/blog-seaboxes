Over the last few months of being at hospital I've created a list of things that indicate I've got a girl with cancer:

1. Vomit bags decorate the house
1. You can talk the medication lingo Ondanse, Max, Dex, Loraz, Oxy, Lasix, Cyclo, Vinc, Dox, Cisplat …
1. Don't go to the beach or swimming as you know the central line can't get wet
1. A 'day pack' now includes a medications you know the ED don't regularly carry
1. You know your childs' name, date of birth and allergy status
1. It's not uncommon or uncomfortable to have conversations about wee poo and vomit (much like when you have a baby)
1. You know how to be a patient patient, you've jumped the queue before when things were serious, so you know why there are people ahead of you.
1. Much patience and flexibility is required to get your child to do what you want (choose your battles, look for distraction/rewards, give limited choice)
1. You know your childs' name, date of birth and allergy status
1. You know your childs hospital ID(UR) number
1. You not only know all her stuffed toys names, but their attitudes
1. Know that sometimes it's easier to hook up NG feeding than have the one hour *I'm hungry but I don't know what I want* conversation
1. Have a hospital day bag always half packed ready to go
1. Have a check list of the things not to forget for a hospital day trip
1. You know your childs' name, date of birth and allergy status
1. Know that the car park full sign means you've still got 90% chance of finding a park (even if it takes 15 minutes to find it)
1. Drink sensibly and keep under the limit, in case you have to drive back to hospital
1. Know what is like to sit in the back seat of your car
1. Can scan a room full of kids, pick out the one with a runny nose and divert your child from going anywhere near them
1. Know that it takes at lest 2 hospital 'towels' to dry yourself
1. Wash your hands before, during and after eating
1. You have a three vomit bags in site at all times
1. Stickers, the prize box and playdoh are currency
1. Know the smell of an antibiotic wee
1. Eat smelly food outside the room.. Unless you don't mind catching vomit while eating.
1. Don't eat spicy food, just in case the after effects cause …vomiting
1. Are skilled at the art of waking from a deep sleep, jumping out of bed and catching vomit
1. Think you're good at 'biting your tongue' when you're tired and cranky and have an opinion on return everything
1. You know that you can't play Happy Chef in the iPad when she's nauseous
1. You know the difference between a cough and a the start of a vomit … ahh.. No, no you can't
1. Paper towel is the official note paper of nurses
1. You can cook bacon and eggs on an underpowered sandwich toaster without fire alarms going off
1. Blend 43 tastes ok if it's double shot with two sugars and you really really, really need to be caffeinated
1. Have no trouble discussing a bowel motions and what a poonami and overflow is with the doctors
1. Can flick a vomit bad open on one movement of the wrist
1. Just like camping... Use a cup if you forgot the bowl; a spoon makes an ok fork if you can’t find one
1. As with everywhere.. Build a relationship with the receptionist and cleaner, they are valuable people to know

This is the start of my [#HospitalHack](/tags/#HospitalHacks) series of posts, over the coming weeks/months I hope to share how I've made our hospital admissions a little more bearable.
