After a short 'no visual contact' engagement, Billy and Bilbina got married on Sunday 15 May 2016.

## Backstory
Bilbies became Violets' favourite animal after an <a href="http://www.bunyavileec.eq.edu.au/programs/easter-bilby-adventure/easter-bilby-adventure.html">excursion last year </a>to learn about their endangered status. Shortly after, one of Mum's friends knit Violet a Bilby, it was named "Bilbina". Bilbina is slept with most nights, has been with Violet on every hospital visit and is a much loved toy. Bilbina is regularly called a rat or a possum by doctors who can't see the distinctive tail; on one occasion she was called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_the_Rat">Siberian hamster</a> (by a Fawlty Towers loving doctor).

## The Engagement
Violet required to be in isolation for her BMT hospital stay. Anything taken into isolation either needs to be wiped down with alcohol wipes or washed at 70 degrees. If anything touches the floor it needs to be wiped or washed again. A day without Bilbina would be very difficult, so Billy the backup Bilby was knit (thank you again Marling!). Billy was hot washed and separated from Bilbina to reduce the risk of two Bilbies on the floor. Note: Stuffed Bilbies do not wash well at 70 degrees, it was unlikely either Bilby would last a 2nd hot wash. It took a week before Bilbina jumped from the bed during her sleep, so Violet met Billy and Billy was tied to the ceiling so he wouldn't touch the floor. During her BMT stay Violet informed us that Billy and Bilbina were engaged and would be married when she returned home, planning the wedding became a great way to keep Violet occupied and a great discussion point for nurses and visitors.
