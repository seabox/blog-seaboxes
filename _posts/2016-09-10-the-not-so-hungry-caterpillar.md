A little girl's bald head reflects the light of the morning sun.

It's Sunday morning. Her sleepy eyes open - pop!- under the warm blankets is a very skinny, scrawny (not so) hungry caterpillar.

She asks her Mum for some food. (This equates to yelling as if someone is attacking her to allow for the fastest possible reaction time).

Her mother asks what she wants to eat. "I don't know" she replies. "Just food."

On Monday she asks for a cheese and bacon balls. After making a special trip to the shops, she takes one look and says "I don't want them anymore."

On Tuesday she asks for a choc chip muffin. After spending an hour baking, muffins are delivered fresh and warm, she picks it up and says "I don't feel like them anymore."
Her mother eats it.

On Wednesday she asks for a lime milkshake. After walking every street and scouring every shop within a 3km radius and returning with the shake, she takes one sip and says "I'm done." Her mother finishes it.

On Thursday she asks for strawberries. Strawberries are delivered, tastefully arranged on a plate. "No" says the (not so) hungry caterpillar "they need to be cut smaller". The now somewhat smaller strawberries are once again served. She takes one nibble and says "these taste gross."

On Friday she nibbles one piece of cheese, one jatz and glances at a bowl of 2 minute noodles.

On Saturday she eats 1/3 of an avocado sushi, nibbles a choc chip cookie, a corn chip and a licks a spoonful of ice-cream. Her mother eats the leftovers. That night the caterpillar has a bellyache. She vomits said sushi. (Apparently seaweed does not digest quickly).

The next day is Sunday again. The caterpillar vomits once more and feels much better.

Now the (not so) hungry caterpillar is feeling hungry again. (See paragraph 1)

Mother caterpillar, however, is not so hungry. She has built a small house - similar to a cocoon around her middle. (She is still waiting for the butterfly to appear).
