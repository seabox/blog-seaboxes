I partially wrote this to remember how tough some things were/are. I partially wrote it so others might 'get it', knowing some never will. It's a slightly different view on my '<a href="https://blog.seaboxes.com/2016/09/20/i-see-you-friend.html">I see you friend</a>' and '<a href="https://blog.seaboxes.com/2016/09/25/pre-admission-tradition.html">pre-admission tradition</a>' posts.

There's a lot that can be inferred or assumed by a nice photo, forced smile or positive post, but there's also a lot that people don't see or feel. This post may be a little dark (which is not a place we usually are), but it's the reality of some of my thoughts and days.

You'll never really know...
<ul>
	<li>The actual risk of infection. Seeing kids who have been isolated in hospital for months, taken to ICU and passed away becomes a real threat.</li>
	<li>What it's like to choose quality over quantity of life for your child</li>
	<li>How hard it is to have faith in God when the medical stats say different</li>
	<li>How emotionally full and tired we get that...
<ul>
	<li>Your capacity to deal with others is zero</li>
	<li>holding a conversation is difficult</li>
	<li>the presence of someone else is irritating</li>
	<li>The right words to describe things just don't come out</li>
	<li>You don't have empathy for what others are going through because it seems like 'less' of a burden than what we're dealing with</li>
	<li>Feedback is taken as a personal attack</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>That any routine I can grasp is a safe place</li>
	<li>How hard it is to take your child to hospital to make her sicker than you've ever experienced, because you know it will make her better in the long run</li>
	<li>How important is is to wash your hands</li>
	<li>What diarrhoea really is until you've dealt with the stomach lining and gastrointestinal tract being purged from chemo</li>
	<li>To be on edgeâ€¦
<ul>
	<li>EVERY time your child coughs, to be on guard, because that's how vomit starts</li>
	<li>EVERY time someone near your child coughs, to be on guard, because that's how viruses and infections start.</li>
	<li>every night, ready to get up and calm her from bad dreams then sleep on her floor</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>How much we enjoy silence and or own space</li>
	<li>How to juggle the emotions of the other kids, how much it hurts to not have enough time to make them emotionally resilient</li>
	<li>What is like to find activities out of the sun because your child has super sensitive skin</li>
	<li>What is like not to have a swim because your child has a central line</li>
	<li>What it's like to wrap up your child in plastic for every bath so their central line doesn't get wet</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Waves in my ocean seem like tsunami to others and a drip to some. Perspective and empathy for others is also something I ponder, I may never know:
<ul>
	<li>What others go through, children with lifelong or more debilitating illness</li>
	<li>What it would be like if we were regional and had to travel long distances to hospital</li>
	<li>What is like for a grandparent to see a grandchild suffer and your child to deal with it</li>
	<li>What being referred to paediatric palliative care would be like</li>
</ul>
