It's no secret we've spent a lot of time in the Bible during Violets treatment. Many Bible studies, devotionals and Pintrest sessions lead to the list below. You may notice some duplicates below as Bible versions bring out different emphasis. I'm sure I've missed some verses but I hope you find some inspiration in His word, just as we have.

&nbsp;

Dear brothers and sisters, when troubles of any kind come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy. <strong>For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow.</strong> So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, <strong>you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing</strong>.
<em>James 1:2‭-‬4 (NLT) - <a href="http://bible.com/116/jas.1.2-4.NLT">http://bible.com/116/jas.1.2-4.NLT</a></em>

<strong><em>Feed your faith, starve your doubts...</em></strong>
If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking. But when you ask him, <strong>be sure that your faith is in God alone. Do not waver</strong>, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind."
<em>James 1:5-6 (NIV) - <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JAS.1.5-6">https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JAS.1.5-6</a></em>

<strong>Don’t fret or worry. Instead of worrying, pray.</strong> Let petitions and praises shape your worries into prayers, letting God know your concerns. Before you know it, a sense of God’s wholeness, everything coming together for good, will come and settle you down. It’s wonderful what happens when Christ displaces worry at the center of your life.
<em>Philippians 4:6-7 (MSG) - <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/97/PHP.4.6">https://www.bible.com/bible/97/PHP.4.6</a></em>

<strong>Rejoice in the Lord always.</strong> I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
<em>Philippians 4:4‭-‬7 (NIV) - <a href="http://bible.com/111/php.4.4-7.NIV">http://bible.com/111/php.4.4-7.NIV</a></em>

So be truly glad. There is wonderful joy ahead, even though you must endure many trials for a little while. These <strong>trials will show that your faith is genuine</strong>. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold—though your faith is far more precious than mere gold. So <strong>when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring you much praise and glory and honor</strong> on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed to the whole world.
<em>1 Peter 1:6‭-‬7 (NLT)  - <a href="http://bible.com/116/1pe.1.6-7.NLT">http://bible.com/116/1pe.1.6-7.NLT</a></em>

Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God’s glory. We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation.
