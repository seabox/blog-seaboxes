A lot of people commented on how strong we are through Violets cancer journey; one of our friends early on created this artwork which encompasses one of the main feelings we had.

We are <strong>carried</strong> by our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

I had read about footsteps in the sand and seen verses about <a href="http://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/God-Carrying-People">being carried,</a> but never experienced it until now.

I don't believe <a href="http://faithit.com/christine-suhan-christians-stop-saying-everything-happens-reason/">God causes the trials/challenges</a> in our lives but he carries us through and promises greater glory on the other side. I've <a href="https://blog.seaboxes.com/2016/11/20/james-has-it-wrong.html">previously posted </a>a tongue in cheek look at the many verses about this.

I also know God has been with us throughout this. Chis Tomlins song "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q24z4XcJxnM">Whom shall I fear</a>" has a great line "the God of angel armies is always by my side". This is actually based on <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2KI.6.16-17">2 Kings 6:16-17</a> (NIV)
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>“Don’t be afraid,” the prophet answered. “Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” And Elisha prayed, “Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.” Then the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha</em></p>
…his own army of angels.

Praising God with a great song is something we enjoy, clearing or mind of all the worries and giving all the glory to God. Many trips in the car by ourselves had allowed us to turn up the volume and sing to our Lord. Favourites through this time include King of my heart, No longer slaves, O Lord &amp; 10,000 reasons (see/listen to the <a href="http://bit.ly/2oe6mMp">full list on YouTube</a>)

We trust the medical professionals, we're blessed.. But through Christ we see things in a different light…
<p style="padding-left:30px;">When the oncologist says… <strong>if</strong> she makes it to that &lt;&lt;positive&gt;&gt; point
Through Christ we hear … <strong>when</strong> she makes it to that point</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">When the oncologist says… if that &lt;&lt;negative&gt;&gt; thing happens
We pray… that &lt;&lt;negative&gt;&gt; thing won't happen, in Jesus name!</p>
Which brings me to the next point, Prayer. God's yolk is easy. Putting those worries and concerns for him to deal with is easy. We've had a small army of people praying for Violet as well, there are many days that their faith, strength and commitment to prayer is bigger than ours. Thank you!

Initially when people would say they are "sending positive vibes" to me it felt like fingernails on a chalkboard. Thinking about this further I now translate it to "I don't know God yet, but if I did, I'd be praying for you"

There are many Bible verses that have inspired us over time, reading and meditating on <a href="https://blog.seaboxes.com/2017/04/17/verses-to-get-you-through.html">these verses</a> over the last 18 months has definitely helped.
