When Colleen and I got married we became equal partners, for better for worse, till death do us part. We made the commitment to stick by each other and see things through, no matter how difficult they get. We also come from good stock, parents and grandparents setting a fabulous example with marriages decades long.

There's no doubt Violet's cancer has stretched us waaaay beyond where we ever thought. But our love and commitment for each other has never been deeper. Our faith and how its grown and been shared through this has played a big part of this. Our marriage is about equal partnership and respect for one another, male chauvinism has no place and no task is gender specific cooking/cleaning/mowing/hospital visits is shared.
