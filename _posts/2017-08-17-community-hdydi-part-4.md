<h1 style="text-align:center;"><em>"it takes a village"</em></h1>
I can say I didn't know who was in my village until Violet got cancer. Thinking about it, the village is made up of multiple communities, who have all had different impacts:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Family</strong> - from visiting, to living with us to providing great support. Someone really enjoyed the facetime calls too</li>
	<li><strong>Friends</strong> - Surprise survival packs, car parking cash and random supportive texts!</li>
	<li><strong>School</strong> - WOW, food, picking up kids... I honestly didn't know what chappy's did, but now couldn't be more grateful</li>
	<li><strong>Church </strong>-  prayer, food, house cleaning, lawn mowing</li>
	<li><strong>Work</strong> - passing around the hat, getting extended time off work, complete understanding when returning to work and supporting fundraising efforts</li>
	<li><strong>Hospital</strong> - nurses, doctors, occupational therapists, social workers, so many passionate people we got to know.</li>
	<li><strong>Paediatric oncology community </strong>- No one really knows what you go though, except those closest to the same fire as you. We've met some incredible parents in the oncology wards!</li>
</ul>
