One of the things people said earlier this year was "I don't know how you've done it".  To tell you the truth, neither do I.  If I think about it, if we didn't, who would? The reality is we were in survival mode.

I started these posts around the new year when I was reflecting about our "Christmas Break". It was then I realised we were full, we may have "done it" but we couldn't take/give anymore. We've days we're feisty, irritated and just need space/time/quiet to get through. I'd say Christmas was ok, it wasn't good or great, its hard just having other people in the house, let alone for Christmas celebrations. It got me thinking that it's hard to convey where my capacity is at and it's <a href="/2016/12/31/youll-never-really-know.html">unlikely others will ever understand</a>  and reflect on why I feel so full and overwhelmed.

If I think about how have we've done it, I can think of a number of things that have helped. I've split them into individual "How did you do it (HDYDI)" posts:
