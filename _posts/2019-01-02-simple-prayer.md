There's a couple of prayers I say each day. They are simple for a few reasons:
1) So I can remember them when I'm tired and my brain is fried
2) So they kids can remember them

They maybe simple, but there's depth to them.

For grace:
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Lord God I thank you for this awesome meal and pray you bless it to our bodies to make us Big, Strong, Happy and Healthy.</em></p>
The first part is fine, is the reason we're saying grace, thanking God for providing us a meal to enjoy.
The rest has a little more reasoning...
Big - a big person is humble, doesn't try to "one up"
Strong - not physically, but emotionally
Happy - mentally content
Healthy - physically well

Every now and again I discuss with the kids what the prayer means so they have a deeper acceptance of it.

In recent months I've also had being laying hands on Violet and praying for four H's:
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Lord I pray Violet is Healed, her Hair grows back and we're all Happy and Healthy</em></p>
Healed - cancer/tumor completely gone, never to return.
Hair - Violet longs to have hair again, she's had years without hair.
Happy - as above, that the family is content, mentally well
Health - Violet and the family is healthy, no matter what treatment is thrown her way
