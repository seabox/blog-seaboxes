<p>Bony growth has stopped. Yay.<br>But disease has progressed in her marrow. No! Not again!!<br>She's quite unwell. When do you want to start? Tomorrow?<br>Premeds. Long lasting antiemetics. Diuretics.<br>Drip, drip, drip. Hyper hydration. Weigh the output.<br>Familiar friendly faces, in a way we're home again, but not where we want to be.<br>Ahh, that wasn't as bad as it could be.</p>

<p>Checkup time, 39 degrees, needing packed cells and platelets. What? That's not supposed to be.<br>A simple temperature and a little sniffle. Not so bad. <br>Neutrophils less than 0.01. Sigh.<br>Neutropenia and a temperature. Not so good.<br>Drip, drip, drip. IV hydration. Antibiotics.</p>

<p>Hours turn to days. Tired bleary eyes. Fractured thoughts. Fatigue. <br>Caffeine to see the day through.<br>Neutrophils 0.02. Sigh. Come on marrow.<br>A day, an hour at a time. It's out of my hands. It's in His!<br>Comforting. Hugging. Rewarding. Negotiating. Encouraging. To eat. To take meds. To do another procedure. <br>Persistent temperature continuing. </p>

<p>Sniffle, sniffle. "Can I have another tissue".<br>Hair out in clumps. Hair in food. Hair in mouth. Annoying.<br>Drip, drip, drip. Another bag of platelets.<br>Frustrated. Annoyed. Shave it off!! Ahh, now it's prickly.</p>

<p>Drop offs, pickups, groceries, washing, cooking, cleaning. Routine doesn't stop. <br>Move that meeting, cover me for that. Sorry I need to just take time off. To focus, not to juggle. Extend my leave.<br>Ask for help. Get overwhelmed. Loved.<br>Neutrophils 0.06. Sigh. Not counting chickens. Come on marrow!! </p>

<p>Full name. Date of birth. Does she have any allergies?<br>Panadol. No. She has her own, it's in her box, the strawberry flavoured stuff.<br>Crush that tablet. Swallow this one. Mix the capsule with Lemon yoghurt. <br>Drip, drip, drip. Another bag of packed cells.</p>

<p>Mango smoothie, yum. Three sips in. I'm full. Sigh. It was worth a try.<br>Pink milk for breaky, sure, whatever to keep the NG away.<br>OJ spilt again. Change the sheets.<br>Washed clean hands, dry cracked knuckles. Moisturise.</p>

<p>Day 10, temperatures stop, not counting chickens. Time to wait and see.<br>Marvel movies pass the time. <br>Craft and games with volunteers. Agrocardo!!<br>The hunt for Mickey and Minnie and a giant avocado. <br>It's not a mouse, rat or rabbit, it's a Bilby!!</p>

<p>Day 12, neutrophils 0.23, eating ok. Bag of platelets. Home ðŸ™‚.<br>
Hot shower. Ahhh. Comfy bed. Sleep.<br>
Back to not committing. Not knowing. Just doing what we can.<br>
Restore, refresh, recuperate, renew, relax. Breathe.</p>

<p>A full kitchen instead of the microwave down the hall. <br>
Yay, fresh fruit and nuts, no longer waiting for the cart to come around.<br>
Bacon.. Mmmm, bacon and fresh eggs.<br>
Beeping machines, nurse call bell replaced with sounds of neighbours in their yard.<br>
The heat. The dry. The warm sun.<br>
Eat child eat and drink! Put on weight to avoid the NG.<br>
Stop. Refresh. Relax. Rebuild. Prepare for it all again.</p>
