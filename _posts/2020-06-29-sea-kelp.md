I don't think Dulux were aiming for deeper thought when they created this colour.

But it's definitely got me thinking...

Our minds are fascinating. Keeping them healthy is something thatâ€™s had much more awareness in recent years. But unfortunately, still carries some stigma. I think this maybe because it's easier to deal with the things we see (eg. removing a splinter) than the things we canâ€™t (eg. feelings, emotions and thoughts). 

I recently realised I had a distorted perspective on my own mental health too. I was more than happy to tell others to reach out to a professional, but have danced around the idea myself, because ["Iâ€™m fine"](https://youtu.be/Lp7E973zozc). 

So what shifted? Terminology & Parallels.

### 1) Terminology: Psychologist vs Coach
For some reason, the idea of seeing a Psychologist seemed to be a big thing. The reality is, itâ€™s not, weâ€™ve had all our kids to see one at times, we know friends and family that see them. But it wasnâ€™t until a few things occurred that I thought about it differently.

I was listening to a podcast where a Psychologist mentioned some of his business clients prefer to call him a coach. It probably wasn't until a few months later that I actually thought that term resinated with me, I had had a few sessions with a Psych and was not sure if I was getting anything out of it. Further thinking and I reframed; it's not like I was broken and trying get fixed, but I was being helped to be a better me. I was being coached.

A little while later thinking further, were there other things if I slightly reframed or found parallels for, would it resinate better and would I be less opposed to? *(hmmm... [Mindfulness vs Breathing](/2020/06/28/breathing-hdydi-part-6)  / Yoga vs Stretching)*

### 2) Parallels: Physical vs Mental
Why do we treat physical health different to mental health?    
Thinking this through I came up with the following parallels between physical and mental health. They're not a direct correlation but they help me frame things in a way I understand....

If I wanted to have good physical health, I might start going for regular walks.  
If I want to have good mental health, I might ... not isolate from others.

If I wanted to improve my physical health, I might start going to the gym.  
If I want to improve mental health, I might ... talk to others about how I'm feeling.
    
If I wanted to be physical healthy, I'd eat healthy.  
If I want to be mentally health, I'd eat healthy, be physically healthy and practice some mindfulness.
	
If I wanted to excel in my physical health, I might get a personal trainer/coach.  
If I want to excel in my mental health, might chat to a councillor/therapist/psychologist.
	
If I had a sore back, I might get a massage or go to the physiotherapist.  
If I have unhealthy thoughts, burn out, anxious, depressed, I might chat to a councillor/therapist/psychologist/coach.
	
If I break my arm and need surgery to reset the bones, I'd see an orthopaedic surgeon.   
If I continue to have unhealthy thoughts, I'd see a psychiatrist.
